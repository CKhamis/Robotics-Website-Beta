# Robotics Website Beta
This was a fork of the Apes of Wrath website I published for the team. This was being worked on simultaneously with [Robotics-Website-Milestone-2](https://github.com/CKhamis/Robotics-Website-Milestone-2) and was meant to add larger scale changes to the overall look of the website.

Unfortunately, the currently uploaded version of this project was very early in development and the latest version of this project was not yet recovered.

## Updated Navigation Bar and Banner
The banner of the website is no longer a Flash based animation and is a static image of the logo in a flattened format. The navigation bar was a lot taller than the original version it was based off of.

## Modularity
A central idea of this new website was to make the components of each page referenced rather than defined on each page. Although the files were not recovered, I remember attempting this idea by separating various components such as the banner, footer, and navigation into separate HTML files and embedding them into various pages by using an iframe.
